Editing Credentials
Since it’s encrypted, Rails 5.2 comes with a way to edit the config/credentials.yml.enc file. You can do that by running the following command:

EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit
This will open up a vim editor with the decrypted version of the file (you can use others editors too, not necessarily vim). When you save it, it will encrypt it again using your master key.

You’ll see that the decrypted version of the file looks like any other normal .yml file.

By the time you run the credentials:edit command, If config/master.key and config/credentials.yml.enc don’t exist, Rails will take care of creating them on your behalf.
